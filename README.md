# ros2-remote-control-pod
A new repository has been generated with the source code corresponding to the new ros2-remote-control module for iOS.

This module is composed by 3 directories:

* services: Instantiate the services nodes for ROS2.
* subscribers: Instantiate the subscribers nodes for ROS2.
* topics: Instantiate the publishers nodes for ROS2.

The `ROS2RemoteControlModule` implements a remote control for ROS2. This module allows the connection of the Robobo robot to a ROS2 network, publishing its functionality through ROS2 services and topics.


To test and use the nodes there are multiple options:

1. Install  ```ROS2```

     https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/

2. Use the ```ros1_bridge```

     https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge

   It could be a good approach run the bridge with the next option:
   `ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge --bridge-all-topics`

   Additionally, follow the next repository instructions are necessary to create the compatibility between robobo_msgs from ROS and ROS2:
   https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/doc/index.rst


In all the cases is necessary to create and generate a package with the required ```robobo_msgs``` for the communication:
https://github.com/mintforpeople/robobo-ros2-msgs

* To compile it (in the case 1 & 2):

  `colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select robobo_msgs `

Some examples to test from ROS2... you have to run the next commands from terminal:
* To test if the nodes are launched correctly:

  `ros2 node list`
* To view the topic list:

  `ros2 topic list`
